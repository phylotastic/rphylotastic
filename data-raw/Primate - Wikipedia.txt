Primates arose 55–85 millionyears ago from small terrestrial mammals (Primatomorpha), who adapted to living in the trees oftropical forests: many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challengingenvironment, including large brains, visual acuity, color vision, altered shoulder girdle, anddexterous hands. Primates range in size from Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, which weighs 30 g(1 oz), to the eastern gorilla, weighing over 200 kg (440 lb). There are 190–448 species of livingprimates, depending on which classification is utilized. New primate species continue to bediscovered: over 25 species were described in the first decade of the 2000's, and eleven since 2010.Primates are divided into two distinct suborders (see diagram under History of terminology). Thefirst is the strepsirrhines (from Greek "wet-nosed") - lemurs, galagos, and lorisids. (The colloquialnames ending in "-nosed" actually refer to the rhinarium of the primate.) The second is haplorhines- the "dry-nosed" primates (from Greek "simple-nosed") - tarsiers, monkeys, and apes, the latterincluding humans. Simians (infraorder Simiiformes, from Greek simos "flat-nosed") are monkeysand apes, cladistically including: the catarrhines (from Latin "narrow nosed") consisting of the OldWorld monkeys and apes; and the platyrrhines (from Latin "flat-nosed"): this division occurredabout 60 million years ago. Forty million years ago, simians from Africa migrated to South America,presumably by drifting on debris, and gave rise to the New World monkeys. Twenty five millionyears ago the remaining Old World simians (catarrhines) split into apes and Old World monkeys.Common names for the simians are the (Old World) baboons, macaques, gibbons, and great apes;and the (New World) capuchins, howlers and squirrel monkeys.Primates are characterized by large brains (relative to body size) compared to other mammals, aswell as an increased reliance on visual acuity at the expense of the sense of smell, which is thedominant sensory system in most mammals. These features are more developed in monkeys andapes, and noticeably less so in lorises and lemurs. Trichromatism, three independent channels forconveying color information, is present in some primates. Except for apes, primates have tails. Mostprimates also have opposable thumbs. Many species are sexually dimorphic; differences mayinclude muscle mass, fat distribution, pelvic width, canine tooth size, hair distribution, andcoloration. Primates have slower rates of development than other similarly sized mammals, reachmaturity later, and have longer lifespans. Depending on the species, adults may live in solitude, inmated pairs, or in groups of up to hundreds of members. Some primates, including some great apes(gorillas and humans) and baboons, are primarily terrestrial rather than arboreal; but all speciespossess adaptations for climbing trees. Arboreal locomotion techniques used include leaping fromtree to tree, and swinging between branches of trees (brachiation); terresterial locomotiontechniques include walking on two limbs (bipedalism) and modified walking on four limbs(knuckle-walking).Primates are among the most social of animals, forming pairs or family groups, uni-male harems,and multi-male/multi-female groups. Non-human primates have at four types of social systems,many defined by the amount of movement by adolescent females occurring between groups. Mostprimate species remain at least partly arboreal: the exceptions are some great apes, baboons - andhumans, who left the trees for the ground and now inhabit every continent.Close interactions between humans and non-human primates (NHPs) can create opportunities forthe transmission of zoonotic diseases, especially diseases caused by viruses, including herpes,measles, ebola, rabies, and hepatitis. Thousands of non-human primates are used around the worldin research because of their psychological and physiological similarity to humans. About 60% ofprimate species are threatened with extinction. Common threats include deforestation, forestfragmentation, monkey drives, and primate hunting for use in medicines, as pets, and for food.Large-scale tropical forest clearing for agriculture most threatens primates.History of terminologyClassification of living primatesPreЄ Є O S D C P T J K PgNContents2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 2/22Phylogeny and geneticsEvolutionHybridsClonesAnatomy and physiologyHeadBodySexual dimorphismLocomotionVisionBehaviorSocial systemsInterspecific associationsCognition and communicationAggressionLife historyDiet, feeding and huntingHuntingAs preyTool use and manufactureTool useTool manufactureEcologyInteractions between humans and other primatesDisease transmissionLegal and social statusRole in scientific researchExtinction threatsSee alsoFootnotesReferencesLiterature citedFurther readingExternal linksThe English name "primates" is derived from Old French or French primat, from a noun use of Latin primat,from primus ("prime, first rank").[2] Thename was given by Carl Linnaeus because he thought this the "highest" order of animals.[3] The relationships among the different groups of primates werenot clearly understood until relatively recently, so the commonly used terms are somewhat confused. For example, "ape" has been used either as analternative for "monkey" or for any tailless, relatively human-like primate.[4]Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was one of the primatologists who developed the idea of trends in primate evolution and the methodology of arranging the livingmembers of an order into an "ascending series" leading to humans.[5] Commonly used names for groups of primates such as "prosimians", "monkeys","lesser apes", and "great apes" reflect this methodology. According to our current understanding of the evolutionary history of the primates, several of thesegroups are paraphyletic: a paraphyletic group is one which does not include all the descendants of the group's common ancestor.[6]In contrast with Clark's methodology, modern classifications typically identify (or name) only those groupings that are monophyletic; that is, such a namedgroup includes all the descendants of the group's common ancestor.[7]The cladogram below shows one possible classification sequence of the living primates:[8][9] groups that use common (traditional) names are shown on theright.PrimatomorphaDermopteraPrimates Haplorhini Simiiformes Catarrhini Hominoidea Hominidae Homininae Homininihumans (genus Homo)History of terminology2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 3/22chimpanzees (genus PanGorillinigorillas (genusorangutans (subfamily Ponginae)gibbons (family Hylobatidae)Old World monkeys (superfamily Cercopithecoidea)New World monkeys (parvorder Platyrrhini)Tarsiiformes tarsiers (superfamily Tarsioidea)Strepsirrhini Lemuriformes[a]lemurs (superfamily Lemuroidea)lorises and allies (superfamily Lorisoidea)All groups with scientific names are monophyletic (that is, they are clades), and the sequence of scientific classification reflects the evolutionary history ofthe related lineages. Groups that are traditionally named are shown on the right; they form an "ascending series" (per Clark, see above), and several groupsare paraphyletic:"prosimians" contain two monophyletic groups (the suborder Strepsirrhini, or lemurs, lorises and allies, as well as the tarsiers of the suborderHaplorhini); it is a paraphyletic grouping because it excludes the Simiiformes, which also are descendants of the common ancestor Primates."monkeys" comprise two monophyletic groups, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys, but is paraphyletic because it excludes hominoids,superfamily Hominoidea, also descendants of the common ancestor Simiiformes."apes" as a whole, and the "great apes" in particular, are paraphyletic because they exclude humans.Thus, the members of the two sets of groups, and hence names, do not match, which causes problems in relating scientific names to common (usuallytraditional) names. Consider the superfamily Hominoidea: In terms of the common names on the right, this group consists of apes and humans and there isno single common name for all the members of the group. One remedy is to create a new common name, in this case "hominoids". Another possibility is toexpand the use of one of the traditional names. For example, in his 2005 book, the vertebrate palaeontologist Benton wrote, "The apes, Hominoidea, todayinclude the gibbons and orang-utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans";[10] thereby Benton was using "apes" to mean "hominoids". In that case,the group heretofore called "apes" must now be identified as the "non-human apes".As of 2005, there is no consensus as to which methodology will rule, whether to accept traditional (that is, common), but paraphyletic, names or to usemonophyletic names only; or to use 'new' common names or adaptations of old ones. Both competing approaches will be found in biological sources, oftenin the same work, and sometimes by the same author. Thus, Benton defines "apes" to include humans, then he repeatedly uses "ape-like" to mean "like anape rather than a human"; and when discussing the reaction of others to a new fossil he writes of "claims that Orrorin ... was an ape rather than ahuman".[11]A list of the families of the living primates is given below, together with one possible classification into ranks between order and family.[1][8][12][13] Otherclassifications are also used. For example, an alternative classification of the living Strepsirrhini divides them into two infraorders, Lemuriformes andLorisiformes.[14]Classification of living primates2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 4/22EuarchontogliresGliresRodentia (rodents)Lagomorpha (rabbits, hares, pikas)EuarchontaOrder PrimatesSuborder Strepsirrhini: lemurs, galagos and lorisidsInfraorder Lemuriformes[a]Superfamily LemuroideaFamily Cheirogaleidae: dwarf lemurs and mouse-lemurs (34 species)Family Daubentoniidae: aye-aye (one species)Family Lemuridae: ring-tailed lemur and allies (21 species)Family Lepilemuridae: sportive lemurs (26 species)Family Indriidae: woolly lemurs and allies (19 species)Superfamily LorisoideaFamily Lorisidae: lorisids (14 species)Family Galagidae: galagos (19 species)Suborder Haplorhini: tarsiers, monkeys and apesInfraorder TarsiiformesFamily Tarsiidae: tarsiers (11 species)Infraorder Simiiformes (or Anthropoidea)Parvorder Platyrrhini: New World monkeysFamily Callitrichidae: marmosets and tamarins (42 species)Family Cebidae: capuchins and squirrel monkeys (14 species)Family Aotidae: night or owl monkeys (douroucoulis) (11 species)Family Pitheciidae: titis, sakis and uakaris (43 species)Family Atelidae: howler, spider, woolly spider and woolly monkeys (29 species)Parvorder CatarrhiniSuperfamily CercopithecoideaFamily Cercopithecidae: Old World monkeys (138 species)Superfamily HominoideaFamily Hylobatidae: gibbons or "lesser apes" (18 species)Family Hominidae: great apes, including humans (8 species)Order Primates was established by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, in the tenth edition of his book Systema Naturae,[17] for thegenera Homo (humans), Simia (other apes and monkeys), Lemur (prosimians) and Vespertilio (bats). In the first editionof the same book (1735), he had used the name Anthropomorpha for Homo, Simia and Bradypus (sloths).[18] In 1839,Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, following Linnaeus and imitating his nomenclature, established the ordersSecundates (including the suborders Chiroptera, Insectivora and Carnivora), Tertiates (or Glires) and Quaternates(including Gravigrada, Pachydermata and Ruminantia),[19] but these new taxa were not accepted.Before Anderson and Jones introduced the classification of Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini in 1984,[20] (followedby McKenna and Bell's 1997 work Classification of Mammals: Above the species level),[21] the Primates weredivided into two superfamilies: Prosimii and Anthropoidea.[22] Prosimii included all of the prosimians:Strepsirrhini plus the tarsiers. Anthropoidea contained all of the simians.Order Primates is part of the clade Euarchontoglires, which is nested within the clade Eutheria of ClassMammalia. Recent molecular genetic research on primates, colugos, and treeshrews has shown that the twospecies of colugos are more closely related to primates than to treeshrews,[23] even though treeshrews were atone time considered primates.[24] These three orders make up the clade Euarchonta. The combination of thisclade with the clade Glires (composed of Rodentia and Lagomorpha) forms the clade Euarchontoglires.Variously, both Euarchonta and Euarchontoglires are ranked as superorders. Some scientists considerDermoptera to be a suborder of Primates and use the suborder Euprimates for the "true" primates.[25]The primate lineage is thought to go back at least near the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary or around 63–74(mya),[26][27][28][29][30] even though the oldest known primatesfrom the fossil record date to the Late Paleocene of Africa(Altiatlasius)[31] or the Paleocene-Eocene transition in thenorthern continents, c. 55 mya (Cantius, Donrussellia, Altanius,Plesiadapis and Teilhardina).[32][33][34] Other studies, includingA 1927 drawing ofchimpanzees, a gibbon (topright) and two orangutans(center and bottom center):The chimpanzee in theupper left is brachiating; theorangutan at the bottomcenter is knuckle-walking.Homo sapiens are the onlyliving primate species thatis fully bipedalNilgiri langur (Trachypithecus johnii),an Old World monkeyPhylogeny and geneticsEvolution2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 5/22Scandentia (treeshrews)PrimatomorphaDermoptera (colugos)Primates†Plesiadapiformescrown primatesAxis scale: million yearsAlso see: Life timeline and Nature timelineHominin timelinemolecular clock studies, have estimated the origin of the primatebranch to have been in the mid-Cretaceous period, around 85mya.[35][36][37]By modern cladistic reckoning, the order Primates is monophyletic.The suborder Strepsirrhini, the "wet-nosed" primates, is generallythought to have split off from the primitive primate line about63 mya,[38] although earlier dates are also supported.[39] The sevenstrepsirrhine families are the five related lemur families and thetwo remaining families that include the lorisids and the galagos.[1][12] Older classificationschemes wrap Lepilemuridae into Lemuridae and Galagidae into Lorisidae, yielding afour-one family distribution instead of five-two as presented here.[1] During the Eocene,most of the northern continents were dominated by two groups, the adapiforms and theomomyids.[40][41] The former are considered members of Strepsirrhini, but did not havea toothcomb like modern lemurs; recent analysis has demonstrated that Darwiniusmasillae fits into this grouping.[42] The latter was closely related to tarsiers, monkeys,and apes. How these two groups relate to extant primates is unclear. Omomyids perishedabout 30 mya,[41] while adapiforms survived until about 10 mya.[43]According to genetic studies, the lemurs of Madagascar diverged from the lorisoidsapproximately 75 mya.[39] These studies, as well as chromosomal and molecularevidence, also show that lemurs are more closely related to each other than to otherstrepsirrhine primates.[39][44] However, Madagascar split from Africa 160 mya and fromIndia 90 mya.[45] To account for these facts, a founding lemur population of a fewindividuals is thought to have reached Madagascar from Africa via a single rafting eventbetween 50 and 80 mya.[39][44][45] Other colonization options have been examined, suchas multiple colonizations from Africa and India, but none are supported by the geneticand molecular evidence.[40]Until recently, the aye-aye has been difficult to place within Strepsirrhini.[1] Theories hadbeen proposed that its family, Daubentoniidae, was either a lemuriform primate(meaning its ancestors split from the lemur line more recently than lemurs and lorisessplit) or a sister group to all the other strepsirrhines. In 2008, the aye-aye family wasconfirmed to be most closely related to the other Malagasy lemurs, likely havingdescended from the same ancestral population that colonized the island.[39]Suborder Haplorhini, the simple-nosed or "dry-nosed" primates, is composed of twosister clades.[1] Prosimian tarsiers in the family Tarsiidae (monotypic in its owninfraorder Tarsiiformes), represent the most basal division, originating about 58mya.[46][47] The earliest known haplorhine skeleton, that of 55 MA old tarsier-likeArchicebus, was found in central China,[48] supporting an already suspected Asian originfor the group.[49] The infraorder Simiiformes (simian primates, consisting of monkeysand apes) emerged about 40 mya,[41] possibly also in Asia; if so, they dispersed across theTethys Sea from Asia to Africa soon afterwards.[50] There are two simian clades, both parvorders: Catarrhini,which developed in Africa, consisting of Old World monkeys, humans and the other apes, and Platyrrhini, whichdeveloped in South America, consisting of New World monkeys.[1] A third clade, which included the eosimiids,developed in Asia, but became extinct millions of years ago.[51]As in the case of lemurs, the origin of New World monkeys is unclear. Molecular studies of concatenated nuclearsequences have yielded a widely varying estimated date of divergence between platyrrhines and catarrhines,ranging from 33 to 70 mya, while studies based on mitochondrial sequences produce a narrower range of 35 to43 mya.[33][52] The anthropoid primates possibly traversed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to South Americaduring the Eocene by island hopping, facilitated by Atlantic Ocean ridges and a lowered sea level.[40]Alternatively, a single rafting event may explain this transoceanic colonization. Due to continental drift, theAtlantic Ocean was not nearly as wide at the time as it is today.[40] Research suggests that a small 1 kg (2.2 lb)primate could have survived 13 days on a raft of vegetation.[53] Given estimated current and wind speeds, this would have provided enough time to makethe voyage between the continents.Apes and monkeys spread from Africa into Europe and Asia starting in the Miocene.[54] Soon after, the lorises and tarsiers made the same journey. The firsthominin fossils were discovered in northern Africa and date back 5–8 mya.[41] Old World monkeys disappeared from Europe about 1.8 mya.[55] Molecularand fossil studies generally show that modern humans originated in Africa 100,000–200,000 years ago.[56]-10 —–-9 —–-8 —–-7 —–-6 —–-5 —–-4 —–-3 —–-2 —–-1 —–0 —HomininiNakalipithecusOuranopithecusSahelanthropusOrrorinArdipithecusAustralopithecusHomo habilisHomo erectusH. heidelbergensisNeanderthals Homo sapiens←←←←←←← ←← ← ← ←PleistocenePlioceneMioceneHominidsCommon brown lemur, aStrepsirrhine primateEarlier apesGorilla splitPossibly bipedalChimpanzee splitEarliest bipedalStone toolsExit from AfricaEarliest fire useEarliest cookingEarliest clothesModern speechModern humans2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 6/22Although primates are well studied in comparison to other animal groups, several new species have been discoveredrecently, and genetic tests have revealed previously unrecognised species in known populations. Primate Taxonomylisted about 350 species of primates in 2001;[9] the author, Colin Groves, increased that number to 376 for hiscontribution to the third edition of Mammal Species of the World (MSW3).[1] However, publications since thetaxonomy in MSW3 was compiled in 2003 have pushed the number to 424 species, or 658 including subspecies.[13]Primate hybrids usually arise in captivity,[57] but there have also been examples in the wild.[58][59] Hybridizationoccurs where two species' range overlap to form hybrid zones; hybrids may be created by humans when animals areplaced in zoos or due to environmental pressures such as predation.[58] Intergeneric hybridizations, hybrids ofdifferent genera, have also been found in the wild. Although they belong to genera that have been distinct for several million years, interbreeding still occursbetween the gelada and the hamadryas baboon.[60]On 24 January 2018, scientists in China reported in the journal Cell the creation of two crab-eating macaque clones, named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua,using the complex DNA transfer method that produced Dolly the sheep, for the first time.[61][62][63][64][65]The primate skull has a large, domed cranium, which is particularly prominent in anthropoids. The craniumprotects the large brain, a distinguishing characteristic of this group.[66] The endocranial volume (the volumewithin the skull) is three times greater in humans than in the greatest nonhuman primate, reflecting a largerbrain size.[67] The mean endocranial volume is 1,201 cubic centimeters in humans, 469 cm3 in gorillas, 400 cm3in chimpanzees and 397 cm3 in orangutans.[67] The primary evolutionary trend of primates has been theelaboration of the brain, in particular the neocortex (a part of the cerebral cortex), which is involved withsensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, conscious thought and, in humans,language.[68] While other mammals rely heavily on their sense of smell, the arboreal life of primates has led to atactile, visually dominant sensory system,[68] a reduction in the olfactory region of the brain and increasinglycomplex social behavior.[69]Primates have forward-facing eyes on the front of the skull; binocular vision allows accurate distance perception,useful for the brachiating ancestors of all great apes.[66] A bony ridge above the eye sockets reinforces weakerbones in the face, which are put under strain during chewing. Strepsirrhines have a postorbital bar, a bone around the eye socket, to protect their eyes; incontrast, the higher primates, haplorhines, have evolved fully enclosed sockets.[70]Primates show an evolutionary trend towards a reduced snout.[71] Technically, Old World monkeys are distinguishedfrom New World monkeys by the structure of the nose, and from apes by the arrangement of their teeth.[69] In NewWorld monkeys, the nostrils face sideways; in Old World monkeys, they face downwards.[69] Dental pattern in primatesvary considerably; although some have lost most of their incisors, all retain at least one lower incisor.[69] In moststrepsirrhines, the lower incisors and canines form a toothcomb, which is used in grooming and sometimesforaging,[69][72] and the first lower premolar is shaped like a canine.[72] Old World monkeys have eight premolars,compared with 12 in New World monkeys.[69] The Old World species are divided into apes and monkeys depending onthe number of cusps on their molars: monkeys have four, apes have five[69] - although humans may have four or five.[73]The main hominid molar cusp (hypocone) evolved in early primate history, while the cusp of the corresponding primitivelower molar (paraconid) was lost. Prosimians are distinguished by their immobilized upper lips, the moist tip of theirnoses and forward-facing lower front teeth.Primates generally have five digits on each limb (pentadactyly), with keratin nails on the end of each finger and toe. Thebottom sides of the hands and feet have sensitive pads on the fingertips. Most have opposable thumbs, a characteristicprimate feature most developed in humans, though not limited to this order, (opossums and koalas, for example, alsohave them).[66] Thumbs allow some species to use tools. In primates, the combination of opposing thumbs, shortfingernails (rather than claws) and long, inward-closing fingers is a relict of the ancestral practice of gripping branches, and has, in part, allowed somespecies to develop brachiation (swinging by the arms from tree limb to tree limb) as a significant means of locomotion. Prosimians have clawlike nails onthe second toe of each foot, called toilet-claws, which they use for grooming.[66]Emperor tamarin, a New WorldmonkeyHybridsClonesAnatomy and physiologyHeadPrimate crania with brain massesindicatedAn 1893 drawing of thehands and feet of variousprimatesBody2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 7/22The primate collar bone is a prominent element of the pectoral girdle; this allows the shoulder joint broadmobility.[71] Compared to Old World monkeys, apes have more mobile shoulder joints and arms due to thedorsal position of the scapula, broad ribcages that are flatter front-to-back, a shorter, less mobile spine, and withlower vertebrae greatly reduced - resulting in tail loss in some species. Prehensile tails are found in atelids,including the howler, spider, woolly spider, woolly monkeys; and in capuchins. [74][75] Male primates have apendulous penis and scrotal testes.[76][72]Sexual dimorphism is often exhibited in simians, though to a greater degree in Old World species (apes andsome monkeys) than New World species. Recent studies involve comparing DNA to examine both the variationin the expression of the dimorphism among primates and the fundamental causes of sexual dimorphism.Primates usually have dimorphism in body mass[77][78][79] and canine tooth size[80][81][82] along with pelageand skin color.[83] The dimorphism can be attributed to and affected by different factors, including matingsystem,[77][84] size,[84] habitat and diet.[85]Comparative analyses have generated a more complete understanding of the relationship between sexualselection, natural selection, and mating systems in primates. Studies have shown that dimorphism is the productof changes in both male and female traits.[77][86] Ontogenetic scaling, where relative extension of a commongrowth trajectory occurs, may give some insight into the relationship between sexual dimorphism and growthpatterns.[87] Some evidence from the fossil record suggests that there was convergent evolution of dimorphism,and some extinct hominids probably had greater dimorphism than any living primate.[86]Primate species move by brachiation, bipedalism, leaping, arboreal and terrestrial quadrupedalism, climbing,knuckle-walking or by a combination of these methods. Several prosimians are primarily vertical clingers andleapers. These include many bushbabies, all indriids (i.e., sifakas, avahis and indris), sportive lemurs, and alltarsiers.[88] Other prosimians are arboreal quadrupeds and climbers. Some are also terrestrial quadrupeds,while some are leapers. Most monkeys are both arboreal and terrestrial quadrupeds and climbers. Gibbons,muriquis and spider monkeys all brachiate extensively,[55] with gibbons sometimes doing so in remarkablyacrobatic fashion. Woolly monkeys also brachiate at times.[89] Orangutans use a similar form of locomotioncalled quadramanous climbing, in which they use their arms and legs to carry their heavy bodies through thetrees.[55] Chimpanzees and gorillas knuckle walk,[55] and can move bipedally for short distances. Althoughnumerous species, such as australopithecines and early hominids, have exhibited fully bipedal locomotion,humans are the only extant species with this trait.[90]The evolution of color vision in primates is unique among most eutherian mammals. While the remotevertebrate ancestors of the primates possessed three color vision (trichromaticism), the nocturnal, warmblooded,mammalian ancestors lost one of three cones in the retina during the Mesozoic era. Fish, reptiles andbirds are therefore trichromatic or tetrachromatic, while all mammals, with the exception of some primates andmarsupials,[91] are dichromats or monochromats (totally color blind).[72] Nocturnal primates, such as the nightmonkeys and bush babies, are often monochromatic. Catarrhines are routinely trichromatic due to a geneduplication of the red-green opsin gene at the base of their lineage, 30 to 40 million years ago.[72][92]Platyrrhines, on the other hand, are trichromatic in a few cases only.[93] Specifically, individual females must beheterozygous for two alleles of the opsin gene (red and green) located on the same locus of the Xchromosome.[72] Males, therefore, can only be dichromatic, while females can be either dichromatic ortrichromatic. Color vision in strepsirrhines is not as well understood; however, research indicates a range ofcolor vision similar to that found in platyrrhines.[72]Like catarrhines, howler monkeys (a family of platyrrhines) show routine trichromatism that has been traced to an evolutionarily recent geneduplication.[94] Howler monkeys are one of the most specialized leaf-eaters of the New World monkeys; fruits are not a major part of their diets,[89] and thetype of leaves they prefer to consume (young, nutritive, and digestible) are detectable only by a red-green signal. Field work exploring the dietarypreferences of howler monkeys suggests that routine trichromaticism was selected by environment.[93]Vervet hindfoot showing fingerprintridges on the soleSexual dimorphismDistinct sexual size dimorphism canbe seen between the female andtwo male hamadryas baboons.LocomotionDiademed sifaka, a lemur that is avertical clinger and leaperVisionThe tapetum lucidum of a northerngreater galago, typical ofprosimians, reflects the light of thephotographers flashBehaviorSocial systems2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 8/22Primates are among the most social of animals, forming pairs or family groups, uni-male harems, and multi-male/multi-female groups.[95] RichardWrangham stated that social systems of non-human primates are best classified by the amount of movement by females occurring between groups.[96] Heproposed four categories:Female transfer systems – females move away from the group in which they were born. Females of a group will not be closely related whereas maleswill have remained with their natal groups, and this close association may be influential in social behavior. The groups formed are generally quite small.This organization can be seen in chimpanzees, where the males, who are typically related, will cooperate in defense of the group's territory. It isclaimed that the practice was also prevalent in some Neanderthal populations. A 49,000-year-old grave was found in Spain in 2010 which containedthree related-to-each-other males, with three unrelated-to-each-other females, suggesting they were the partners of the males.[97] A 2011 study usingratios of strontium isotopes in teeth also suggested that roughly 2 million years ago, among Australopithecus and Paranthropus robustus groups insouthern Africa, females tended to settle farther from their region of birth than males did.[98][99] Among New World Monkeys, spider monkeys andmuriquis use this system.[100]Male transfer systems – while the females remain in their natal groups, the males will emigrate asadolescents. Polygynous and multi-male societies are classed in this category. Group sizes are usuallylarger. This system is common among the ring-tailed lemur, capuchin monkeys and cercopithecinemonkeys.[55]Monogamous species – a male–female bond, sometimes accompanied by a juvenile offspring. Thereis shared responsibility of parental care and territorial defense. The offspring leaves the parents'territory during adolescence. Gibbons essentially use this system, although "monogamy" in this contextdoes not necessarily mean absolute sexual fidelity.[101] These species do not live in larger groups.Solitary species – often males who defend territories that include the home ranges of several females.This type of organization is found in the prosimians such as the slow loris. Orangutans do not defendtheir territory but effectively have this organization.[102]Other systems are known to occur as well. For example, with howler monkeys both the males and femalestypically transfer from their natal group on reaching sexual maturity, resulting in groups in which neitherthe males nor females are typically related.[89] Some prosimians, colobine monkeys and callitrichidmonkeys use this system.[55]The transfer of females or males from their native group is likely an adaptation for avoidinginbreeding.[103] An analysis of breeding records of captive primate colonies representing numerous different species indicates that the infant mortality ofinbred young is generally higher than that of non-inbred young.[103][104] This effect of inbreeding on infant mortality is probably largely a result ofincreased expression of deleterious recessive alleles (see Inbreeding depression).Primatologist Jane Goodall, who studied in the Gombe Stream National Park, noted fission-fusion societies inchimpanzees.[105] There is fission when the main group splits up to forage during the day, then fusion when thegroup returns at night to sleep as a group. This social structure can also be observed in the hamadryasbaboon,[106] spider monkeys[89] and the bonobo.[106] The gelada has a similar social structure in which manysmaller groups come together to form temporary herds of up to 600 monkeys.[106]These social systems are affected by three main ecological factors: distribution of resources, group size, andpredation.[107] Within a social group there is a balance between cooperation and competition. Cooperativebehaviors include social grooming (removing skin parasites and cleaning wounds), food sharing, and collectivedefense against predators or of a territory. Aggressive behaviors often signal competition for food, sleeping sitesor mates. Aggression is also used in establishing dominance hierarchies.[107][108]Several species of primates are known to associate in the wild. Some of these associations have been extensively studied. In the Tai Forest of Africa severalspecies coordinate anti-predator behavior. These include the Diana monkey, Campbell's mona monkey, lesser spot-nosed monkey, western red colobus,king colobus and sooty mangabey, which coordinate anti-predator alarm calls.[109] Among the predators of these monkeys is the common chimpanzee.[110]The red-tailed monkey associates with several species, including the western red colobus, blue monkey, Wolf's mona monkey, mantled guereza, blackcrested mangabey and Allen's swamp monkey.[106] Several of these species are preyed upon by the common chimpanzee.[111]In South America, squirrel monkeys associate with capuchin monkeys.[112] This may have more to do with foraging benefits to the squirrel monkeys thananti-predation benefits.[112]Primates have advanced cognitive abilities: some make tools and use them to acquire food and for social displays;[113][114] some have sophisticated huntingstrategies requiring cooperation, influence and rank;[115] they are status conscious, manipulative and capable of deception;[116] they can recognise kin andconspecifics;[117][118] and they can learn to use symbols and understand aspects of human language including some relational syntax and concepts ofnumber and numerical sequence.[119][120][121] Research in primate cognition explores problem solving, memory, social interaction, a theory of mind, andnumerical, spatial, and abstract concepts.[122] Comparative studies show a trend towards higher intelligence going from prosimians to New World monkeysto Old World monkeys, and significantly higher average cognitive abilities in the great apes.[123][124] However, there is a great deal of variation in eachgroup (e.g., among New World monkeys, both spider[123] and capuchin monkeys[124] have scored highly by some measures), as well as in the results ofdifferent studies.[123][124]A social huddle of ring-tailed lemurs. Thetwo individuals on the right exposing theirwhite ventral surface are sunningthemselves.The chimpanzees are social greatapes.Interspecific associationsCognition and communication2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 9/22Lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, and New World monkeys rely on olfactory signals for many aspects of social andreproductive behavior.[68] Specialized glands are used to mark territories with pheromones, which are detectedby the vomeronasal organ; this process forms a large part of the communication behavior of these primates.[68]In Old World monkeys and apes this ability is mostly vestigial, having regressed as trichromatic eyes evolved tobecome the main sensory organ.[125] Primates also use vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions to conveypsychological state.[126] Facial musculature is complex in primates, particularly in monkeys and apes. Likehumans, chimpanzees can distinguish the faces of familiar and unfamiliar individuals.[127] Hand and armgestures are also important forms of communication for great apes and a single gesture can have multiplefunctions.[128]The Philippine tarsier, has a high-frequency limit of auditory sensitivity of approximately 91 kHz with adominant frequency of 70 kHz. Such values are among the highest recorded for any terrestrial mammal, and arelatively extreme example of ultrasonic communication. For Philippine tarsiers, ultrasonic vocalizations might represent a private channel ofcommunication that subverts detection by predators, prey and competitors, enhances energetic efficiency, or improves detection against low-frequencybackground noise.[129] Male howler monkeys are among the loudest land mammals and their roars can be heard up to 4.8 km (3.0 mi).[130] Roars areproduced by modified larynx and enlarged hyoid bone which contains an air sac.[131] These calls are thought to relate to intergroup spacing and territorialprotection as well as possibly mate-guarding.[132] The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators, and thereactions of other monkeys vary according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the eaglealarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground.[133] Many non-human primates have the vocal anatomy to produce human speech but lack theproper brain wiring.[134] Vowel-like vocal patterns have been recorded in baboons which has implications for the origin of speech in humans.[135]Non-human primates and humans have been observed to be very similar in terms of personality, such as chimpanzees having “’Big Five’ personality factorsfound in humans, i.e. neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness”. Primates seem to possess a sixth personality trait,dominance.[136] Chimpanzees and bonobos tend to be more social than male orangutans, who cannot be in the same living space. Male gorillas displayaggression during a majority of their interactions while chimpanzees reconcile after their aggressive encounters. Killing males in differing groups in order toexpand territory is an act of violence only seen in chimps and humans. Bonobos tend to live in cohesive communities with lower aggressive incidents.[137]This reduction in reactive aggression committed by male bonobos may be due to the evolution of prominent female groups.Both humans and nonhuman primates, such as chimpanzees, exhibit proactive aggression, a type of preplanned aggression with a reward. This aggressionis expressed between neighboring groups. Proactive aggression ultimately increases the fitness of the community as a whole as the size of the communityincreases. Unlike proactive aggression, reactive aggression is low in humans but high in chimpanzees. Reactive aggression is a result of anger in order tocease a stressful stimulus. Low reactive aggression in humans can be attributed to tolerance and cooperation. Wrangham found “evolution of within-grouptolerance, such as individual selection for cooperative breeding, group selection for parochial altruism, and cultural group selection for prosocial norms”.Ranking in nonhuman primates stems from the most aggressive male, while nomadic hunter-gatherers are respected for their prestige and ability to formalliances and negotiations. Boehm proposed the “execution hypothesis”, or the approval by the community of killing group members who violate the normof the group or are deemed a bully. Hunter-gatherers who attempted to utilize aggression were viewed as a threat and removed from the group. The removalof community threats can be likened to modern capital punishment, more specifically the death penalty.[138]Primates have slower rates of development than other mammals.[55] All primateinfants are breastfed by their mothers (with the exception of some humancultures and various zoo raised primates which are fed formula) and rely on themfor grooming and transportation.[55] In some species, infants are protected andtransported by males in the group, particularly males who may be theirfathers.[55] Other relatives of the infant, such as siblings and aunts, mayparticipate in its care as well.[55] Most primate mothers cease ovulation whilebreastfeeding an infant; once the infant is weaned the mother can reproduceagain.[55] This often leads to weaning conflict with infants who attempt tocontinue breastfeeding.[55]Infanticide is common in polygynous species such as gray langurs and gorillas.Adult males may kill dependent offspring that are not theirs so the female willreturn to estrus and thus they can sire offspring of their own. Social monogamy in some species may have evolved to combat this behavior.[139] Promiscuitymay also lessen the risk of infanticide since paternity becomes uncertain.[140]Primates have a longer juvenile period between weaning and sexual maturity than other mammals of similar size.[55] Some primates such as galagos andnew world monkeys use tree-holes for nesting, and park juveniles in leafy patches while foraging. Other primates follow a strategy of "riding", i.e. carryingindividuals on the body while feeding. Adults may construct or use nesting sites, sometimes accompanied by juveniles, for the purpose of resting, a behaviorwhich has developed secondarily in the great apes.[141][142] During the juvenile period, primates are more susceptible than adults to predation andA pair of black howler monkeysvocalizing.AggressionLife historyA crab-eating macaque breastfeeding her baby2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 10/22starvation; they gain experience in feeding and avoiding predators during this time.[55] They learn social and fighting skills, often through playing.[55]Primates, especially females, have longer lifespans than other similarly sized mammals,[55] this may be partially due to their slower metabolisms.[143] Latein life, female catarrhine primates appear to undergo a cessation of reproductive function known as menopause; other groups are less studied.[144]Primates exploit a variety of food sources. It has been said that many characteristics of modern primates,including humans, derive from an early ancestor's practice of taking most of its food from the tropicalcanopy.[145] Most primates include fruit in their diets to obtain easily digested nutrients including carbohydratesand lipids for energy.[55] Primates in the suborder Strepsirrhini (non-tarsier prosimians) are able to synthesizevitamin C, like most other mammals, while primates of the suborder Haplorrhini (tarsiers, monkeys and apes)have lost this ability, and require the vitamin in their diet.[146]Many primates have anatomical specializations that enable them to exploit particular foods, such as fruit, leaves,gum or insects.[55] For example, leaf eaters such as howler monkeys, black-and-white colobuses and sportivelemurs have extended digestive tracts which enable them to absorb nutrients from leaves that can be difficult todigest.[55] Marmosets, which are gum eaters, have strong incisor teeth, enabling them to open tree bark to get tothe gum, and claws rather than nails, enabling them to cling to trees while feeding.[55] The aye-aye combinesrodent-like teeth with a long, thin middle finger to fill the same ecological niche as a woodpecker. It taps on treesto find insect larvae, then gnaws holes in the wood and inserts its elongated middle finger to pull the larvaeout.[147] Some species have additional specializations. For example, the grey-cheeked mangabey has thickenamel on its teeth, enabling it to open hard fruits and seeds that other monkeys cannot.[55] The gelada is theonly primate species that feeds primarily on grass.[148]Tarsiers are the only extant obligate carnivorous primates, exclusively eating insects, crustaceans, smallvertebrates and snakes (including venomous species).[149] Capuchin monkeys can exploit many different typesof plant matter, including fruit, leaves, flowers, buds, nectar and seeds, but also eat insects and otherinvertebrates, bird eggs, and small vertebrates such as birds, lizards, squirrels and bats.[89]The common chimpanzee eats an omnivorous frugivorous diet. It prefers fruit above all other food items and even seeksout and eats them when they are not abundant. It also eats leaves and leaf buds, seeds, blossoms, stems, pith, bark andresin. Insects and meat make up a small proportion of their diet, estimated as 2%.[150][151] The meat consumptionincludes predation on other primate species, such as the western red colobus monkey.[110] This sometimes involves tooluse. Common chimpanzees sharpen sticks to use as weapons when hunting mammals. This is considered the firstevidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans. Researchers documented 22 occasions where wildchimpanzees fashioned sticks into "spears" to hunt lesser bush babies (Galago senegalensis). In each case, a chimpanzeemodified a branch by breaking off one or both ends and, frequently using its teeth, sharpened the stick. The tools, onaverage, were about 60 cm (24 in) long and 1.1 cm (0.4 in) in circumference. The chimpanzees then jabbed their spearsinto hollows in tree trunks where bush babies slept. There was a single case in which a chimpanzee successfully extracteda bush baby with the tool. The bonobo is an omnivorous frugivore – the majority of its diet is fruit, but it supplementsthis with leaves, meat from small vertebrates, such as anomalures, flying squirrels and duikers,[152] andinvertebrates.[153] In some instances, bonobos have been shown to consume lower-order primates.[154][155]Predators of primates include various species of carnivorans, birds of prey, reptiles and other primates. Even gorillas have been recorded as prey. Predatorsof primates have diverse hunting strategies and as such, primates have evolved several different antipredator adaptations including crypsis, alarm calls andmobbing. Several species have separate alarm calls for different predators such as air-borne or ground-dwelling predators. Predation may have shapedgroup size in primates as species exposed to higher predation pressures appear to live in larger groups.[156] With their technology and increasedintelligence, modern humans are virtually free of threats from other predators and are themselves apex predators.There are many reports of non-human primates using tools, both in the wild or when captive. The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting(mammals, invertebrates, fish), collecting honey, processing food (nuts, fruits, vegetables and seeds), collecting water, weapons and shelter.In 1960, Jane Goodall observed a chimpanzee poking pieces of grass into a termite mound and then raising the grass to his mouth. After he left, Goodallapproached the mound and repeated the behaviour because she was unsure what the chimpanzee was doing. She found that the termites bit onto the grasswith their jaws. The chimpanzee had been using the grass as a tool to “fish” or "dip" for termites.[157] There are more limited reports of the closely relatedDiet, feeding and huntingLeaf eating mantled guereza, aspecies of black-and-white colobusA mouse lemur holds a cut piece offruit in its hands and eatsHuntingHumans have traditionallyhunted prey forsubsistence.As preyTool use and manufactureTool use2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 11/22bonobo using tools in the wild; it has been claimed they rarely use tools in the wild although they use toolsas readily as chimpanzees when in captivity.[158] It has been reported that females, both chimpanzee andbonobo, use tools more avidly than males.[159] Orangutans in Borneo scoop catfish out of small ponds.Anthropologist Anne Russon saw several animals on these forested islands learn on their own to jab atcatfish with sticks, so that the panicked prey would flop out of ponds and into the orangutan's waitinghands[160] There are few reports of gorillas using tools in the wild. An adult female Western lowland gorillaused a branch as a walking stick apparently to test water depth and to aid her in crossing a pool of water.Another adult female used a detached trunk from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food gathering, andanother used a log as a bridge.[161]The black-striped capuchin was the first non-ape primate for which tool use was documented in the wild;individuals were observed cracking nuts by placing them on a stone anvil and hitting them with anotherlarge stone.[162] In Thailand and Myanmar, crab-eating macaques use stone tools to open nuts, oysters andother bivalves, and various types of sea snails.[163] Chacma baboons use stones as weapons; stoning by thesebaboons is done from the rocky walls of the canyon where they sleep and retreat to when they are threatened.Stones are lifted with one hand and dropped over the side whereupon they tumble down the side of the cliff orfall directly to the canyon floor.[164]Although they have not been observed to use tools in the wild, lemurs in controlled settings have been shown tobe capable of understanding the functional properties of the objects they had been trained to use as tools,performing as well as tool-using haplorhines.[165]Tool manufacture is much rarer than simple tool use and probably represents higher cognitive functioning. Soonafter her initial discovery of tool use, Goodall observed other chimpanzees picking up leafy twigs, stripping off the leaves and using the stems to fish forinsects. This change of a leafy twig into a tool was a major discovery. Prior to this, scientists thought that only humans manufactured and used tools, andthat this ability was what separated humans from other animals.[157] Both bonobos and chimpanzees have also been observed making "sponges" out ofleaves and moss that suck up water and are used as grooming tools. Sumatran orangutans have been observed making and using tools. They will break off atree branch that is about 30 cm long, snap off the twigs, fray one end and then use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites.[166][167] In the wild, mandrillshave been observed to clean their ears with modified tools. Scientists filmed a large male mandrill at Chester Zoo (UK) stripping down a twig, apparently tomake it narrower, and then using the modified stick to scrape dirt from underneath its toenails.[168] Captive gorillas have made a variety of tools.[169]Primates evolved from arboreal animals, and many species live most of their lives in trees. Most primate species live intropical rain forests. The number of primate species within tropical areas has been shown to be positively correlated tothe amount of rainfall and the amount of rain forest area.[170] Accounting for 25% to 40% of the fruit-eating animals (byweight) within tropical rainforests, primates play an important ecological role by dispersing seeds of many treespecies.[171]Some species are partially terrestrial, such as baboons and patas monkeys, and a few species are fully terrestrial, such asgeladas and humans. Non-human primates live in a diverse number of forested habitats in the tropical latitudes ofAfrica, India, Southeast Asia, and South America, including rainforests, mangrove forests, and montane forests. Thereare some examples of non-human primates that live outside of the tropics; the mountain-dwelling Japanese macaquelives in the north of Honshū where there is snow-cover eight months of the year; the Barbary macaque lives in the AtlasMountains of Algeria and Morocco. Primate habitats span a range of altitudes: the black snub-nosed monkey has beenfound living in the Hengduan Mountains at altitudes of 4,700 meters (15,400 ft),[172] the mountain gorilla can be foundat 4,200 meters (13,200 ft) crossing the Virunga Mountains,[173] and the gelada has been found at elevations of up to5,000 m (16,000 ft) in the Ethiopian Highlands. Although most species are generally shy of water, a few are goodswimmers and are comfortable in swamps and watery areas, including the proboscis monkey, De Brazza's monkey and Allen's swamp monkey, which hasdeveloped small webbing between its fingers. Some primates, such as the rhesus macaque and gray langurs, can exploit human-modified environments andeven live in cities.[106][174]Close interactions between humans and non-human primates (NHPs) can create pathways for the transmission of zoonotic diseases. Viruses such asHerpesviridae (most notably Herpes B Virus), Poxviridae, measles, ebola, rabies, the Marburg virus and viral hepatitis can be transmitted to humans; insome cases the viruses produce potentially fatal diseases in both humans and non-human primates.[175]A Western lowland gorilla using a stickpossibly to gauge the depth of waterCrab-eating macaques with stoneTool manufacture toolsEcologyRhesus macaque at AgraFort, IndiaInteractions between humans and other primatesDisease transmission2/20/2019 Primate - Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate 12/22Only humans are recognized as persons and protected in law by the United Nations Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights.[b] The legal status of NHPs, on the other hand, is the subject of much debate, with organizationssuch as the Great Ape Project (GAP) campaigning to award at least some of them legal rights.[177] In June 2008,Spain became the first country in the world to recognize the rights of some NHPs, when its parliament's crosspartyenvironmental committee urged the country to comply with GAP's recommendations, which are thatchimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and gorillas are not to be used for animal experiments.[178][179]Many species of NHP are kept as pets by humans, the Allied Effort to Save Other Primates (AESOP) estimatesthat around 15,000 NHPs live as exotic pets in the United States.[180] The expanding Chinese middle class hasincreased demand for NHPs as exotic pets in recent years.[181] Although NHP import for the pet trade wasbanned in the U.S. in 1975, smuggling still occurs along the United States – Mexico border, with prices rangingfrom US$3000 for monkeys to $30,000 for apes.[182]Primates are used as model organisms in laboratories and have been used in space missions.[183] They serve asservice animals for disabled humans. Capuchin monkeys can be trained to assist quadriplegic humans; theirintelligence, memory, and manual dexterity make them ideal helpers.[184]NHPs are kept in zoos around the globe. Historically, zoos were primarily a form of entertainment, but morerecently have shifted their focus towards conservation, education and research. GAP does not insist that allNHPs should be released from zoos, primarily because captive-born primates lack the knowledge and experienceto survive in the wild if released.[185]Thousands of non-human primates are used around the world in research because of their psychological andphysiological similarity to humans.[186][187] In particular, the brains and eyes of NHPs more closely parallelhuman anatomy than those of any other animals. NHPs are commonly used in preclinical trials, neuroscience,ophthalmology studies, and toxicity studies. Rhesus macaques are often used, as are other macaques, Africangreen monkeys, chimpanzees, baboons, squirrel monkeys, and marmosets, both wild-caught and purposebred.[186][188]In 2005, GAP reported that 1,280 of the 3,100 NHPs living in captivity in the United States were used for experiments.[177] In 2004, the European Unionused around 10,000 NHPs in such experiments; in 2005 in Great Britain, 4,652 experiments were conducted on 3,115 NHPs.[189] Governments of manynations have strict care requirements of NHPs kept in captivity. In the US, federal guidelines extensively regulate aspects of NHP housing, feeding,enrichment, and breeding.[190] European groups such as the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments are seeking a ban on all NHP use inexperiments as part of the European Union's review of animal testing legislation.[191]The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists more than a third of primates as criticallyendangered or vulnerable. About 60% of primate species are threatened with extinction, including: 87% ofspecies in Madagascar, 73% in Asia, 37% in Africa, and 36% in South and Central America.[192] Additionally,75% of primate species have decreasing populations.[192] Trade is regulated, as all species are listed by CITES inAppendix II, except 50 species and subspecies listed in Appendix I, which gain full protection fromtrade.[193][194]Common threats to primate species include deforestation, forest fragmentation, monkey drives (resulting fromprimate crop raiding),[195] and primate hunting for use in medicines, as pets, and for food. Large-scale tropicalforest clearing is widely regarded as the process that most threatens primates.[196][197][198] More than 90% ofprimate species occur in tropical forests.[197][199] The main cause of forest loss is clearing for agriculture,although commercial logging, subsistence harvesting of timber, mining, and dam construction also contribute totropical forest destruction.[199] In Indonesia large areas of lowland forest have been cleared to increase palm oilproduction, and one analysis of satellite imagery concluded that during 1998 and 1999 there was a loss of 1,000Sumatran orangutans per year in the Leuser Ecosystem alone.[200]Primates with a large body size (over 5 kg) are at increased extinction risk due to their greater profitability to poachers compared to smaller primates.[199]They reach sexual maturity later and have a longer period between births. Populations therefore recover more slowly after being depleted by poaching orthe pet trade.[201] Data for some African cities show that half of all protein consumed in urban areas comes from the bushmeat trade.[202] Endangeredprimates such as guenons and the drill are hunted at levels that far exceed sustainable levels.[202] This is due to their large body size, ease of transport andprofitability per animal.[202] As farming encroaches on forest habitats, primates feed on the crops, causing the farmers large economic losses.[203] Primatecrop raiding gives locals a negative impression of primates, hindering conservation efforts.[204]Slow lorises are popular in theexotic pet trade, which threatenswild populations.Legal and social statusSam, a rhesus macaque, was flowninto space by NASA in 1959Role in scientific researchExtinction threatsHumans are known to hunt otherprimates for food, so-calledbushmeat.

Largetracts of forest are now rare in Central America.[196][209] This increases the amount of forest vulnerable to edgeeffects such as farmland encroachment, lower levels of humidity and a change in plant life.[210][211] Movementrestriction results in a greater amount of inbreeding, which can cause deleterious effects leading to a populationbottleneck, whereby a significant percentage of the population is lost.[212][213]There are 21 critically endangered primates, 7 of which have remained on the IUCN's "The World's 25 MostEndangered Primates" list since the year 2000: the silky sifaka, Delacour's langur, the white-headed langur, thegray-shanked douc, the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey, the Cross River gorilla and the Sumatran orangutan.[214]Miss Waldron's red colobus was recently declared extinct when no trace of the subspecies could be found from1993 to 1999.[215] A few hunters have found and killed individuals since then, but the subspecies' prospectsremain bleak.[216]a. Although the monophyletic relationship between lemurs and lorisoids is widely accepted, their clade name is not. The term "lemuriform" is used herebecause it derives from one popular taxonomy that clumps the clade of toothcombed primates into one infraorder and the extinct, non-toothcombedadapiforms into another, both within the suborder Strepsirrhini.[15][16] However, another popular alternative taxonomy places the lorisoids in their owninfraorder, Lorisiformes.[14]b.
