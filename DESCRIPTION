Description: This wraps the 'Phylotastic' services APIs described on Web Services at <www.phylotastic.org>. The main use case is to return a phylogenetic tree for a set of species, but the services also include ways to extract species names from web pages, perform taxonomic name resolution, retrieve a list of all descendant species of a taxon, find images of a species, and more.
